# Big O
--------
What is it?
Big O notation is simply how programmers talk about algorithms

Why is it important?

Types of Big O Notation:

O(1) - Constant Time
- Always take the same amount of time to be executed
----------------
O(n) - Linear Time Complexity
- The time it takes to execute the algorithm is directly proprtional to the input size *n*
---------------
O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity
- The time it takes to run the algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the input size *n*
---------------
O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity
- The time it takes to execute is proportional to the square of the input size
----------------
