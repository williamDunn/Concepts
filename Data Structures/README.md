# Data Structures

What are data structures?
- Simply ways of organizing data

Why are they used?
- Organizes, manages, and stores data

Types of data structures:

Linear vs Non-linear
--------------------
**Linear** data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent
- In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only.

**Non-linear** data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly
- In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure.


- Linear
    - Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List
- Non-linear
    - Graphcs, trees
