# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
-----------------------------------
There are 4 basic OOP concepts:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism


What is: 
## Abstraction
* Simple things to represent complexity
    * Simple: objects, classes, variables, method(parameters)
    * Complexity: How a method is implemented, Calculations to perform to create a result
    
What is: 
## Encapsulation
* Simple things to represent complexity
